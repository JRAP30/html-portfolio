 <h2>My best 3 movies</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Inception </h3>
 <p>A mind-bending thriller that explores the art of "extraction" – the theft of secrets from deep within the subconscious
during the dream state. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Dom Cobb, a skilled thief given a chance at redemption if he can
successfully perform an "inception," planting an idea in someone’s mind without them knowing. The film is renowned for
its complex narrative structure and stunning visual effects.</p>
 <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
 <p>Based on a novella by Stephen King, this film follows the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is
wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover. Over the years, he forms an unlikely friendship with
fellow inmate Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and finds solace and eventual redemption through acts of common
decency. It's a powerful tale of hope and perseverance.</p>
 <h3>Parasite</h3>
 <p>This South Korean film tells the story of the Kim family, who infiltrate the wealthy Park family by posing as unrelated,
highly qualified individuals. What starts as a cunning infiltration turns into a dark and twisted tale of greed, class
disparity, and the lengths people go to for survival. The film garnered international acclaim and won the Palme d'Or at
Cannes, along with four Oscars including Best Picture.</p>
